# Tailwind Tutor

Tailwind Tutor is an interactive web application designed to help developers practice and improve their Tailwind CSS skills. The app provides a target design to replicate, a live code editor to implement solutions, and instant visual feedback by comparing the target design with the user's implementation.

## Features

- **Example Targets**: Practice with pre-defined Tailwind CSS designs.
- **Live Code Editor**: Write and edit Tailwind CSS directly in the app.
- **Visual Feedback**: Compare your implementation with the target design.
- **Interactive Learning**: Improve your skills through hands-on practice and iteration.
- **Responsive Designs**: Learn to create designs that work across various screen sizes.
